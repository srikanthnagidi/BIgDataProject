Predicting the Possibilty of Appearance of a Cited Paper on YouTube Based on its Social Media Features

ABSTRACT:
  The possibilty of appearance of a cited paper on YouTube is
predicted using the social media features. The entire Altmetrics
dataset was taken into consideration and then sampling was
performed to obtain the training set. The above sample was
subjected to normalization to ensure that the data was in the
optimal range. Features were selected one at a time after which a
total of twelve features were selected for the classification.
Seventy percent of the dataset was divided into the training set
and the rest of the data was divided into test set. The class
imbalance problem was dealt by using Synthetic Minority
Oversampling Technique(SMOTE). Classifiers like K-Nearest
Neighbour, Logistic Regression, RandomForest, Decision Trees
and Logistic Regression with Smote were used for classification.
The metrics on which the classifiers were tested was selected to
be precision and recall. For our project, recall was considered to
be the primary metric. The classifier having the highest recall was
selected. The confusion matrix was obtained and the ROC curve
was plotted.
